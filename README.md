# CLIF ICU Respiratory Failure Trajectories, Air Pollution Exposure, and Outcomes

## CLIF VERSION
2.1

---

# Objective

This project evaluates whether **long-term ambient air pollution exposure (PM₂.₅ and NO₂)** is associated with **early physiologic trajectories of acute respiratory failure (ARF)** and clinical outcomes among critically ill patients admitted to the ICU.

Using high-resolution physiologic data from the **Critical Care Informatics Framework (CLIF)**, the study reconstructs **hourly respiratory and physiologic trajectories during the first 72 hours of ICU care**. These trajectories are then grouped into phenotypic clusters representing distinct patterns of respiratory failure evolution.

The analysis evaluates whether chronic environmental exposure is associated with:

- Distinct early respiratory failure trajectory phenotypes
- Increased severity of respiratory failure
- Greater risk of invasive mechanical ventilation
- Higher ICU mortality
- Longer ICU length of stay

Because CLIF data are distributed across multiple institutions, this project is designed as a **federated analysis pipeline** in which each site executes the analysis locally and exports **PHI-safe cluster summaries and model results**.

# Study Design Overview

The analytic workflow consists of four major stages:

### 1. ICU Cohort Construction

Eligible ICU hospitalizations are identified using CLIF administrative tables.

### 2. Hourly Physiologic Trajectory Reconstruction

During the first **0–72 hours after ICU admission**, the following physiologic domains are reconstructed hourly:

- Respiratory support state
- Acute respiratory failure subtype
- Vasopressor exposure

### 3. Trajectory Phenotyping

Sequence clustering is performed using **TraMineR optimal matching distances** to identify distinct respiratory trajectory phenotypes.

### 4. Environmental Exposure Modeling

Multivariable models evaluate whether long-term exposure to:

- PM₂.₅
- NO₂

is associated with trajectory phenotype membership and clinical outcomes.

# Cohort Identification

Eligible hospitalizations must meet:

1. Age ≥ 18 years  
2. ICU admission recorded in the `adt` table  
3. Available respiratory support data  
4. Available geographic identifier for exposure assignment  

Only the **first ICU admission per hospitalization** is used.

---

# Trajectory Construction

Hourly trajectories are constructed for **0–72 hours following ICU admission**.

Each hour is assigned a composite physiologic state composed of:

### Respiratory Support Tier

Derived from `respiratory_support.device_category`.

### Acute Respiratory Failure Subtype

Defined using physiologic criteria.

Hypoxemic ARF:

- SpO₂ < 90% on room air  
- PaO₂ ≤ 60 mmHg on room air  
- PaO₂ / FiO₂ ≤ 300  

Hypercapnic ARF:

- PaCO₂ ≥ 45 mmHg **AND** pH < 7.35

Combined states:

- `ARF_HYPOX`
- `ARF_HYPER`
- `ARF_MIXED`
- `NO_ARF`

### Vasopressor Use

Binary indicator of vasoactive medication administration.

---

# Sequence Clustering

Hourly states are combined into patient-level sequences.

Sequence clustering is performed using:

- **Optimal Matching distance**
- **Transition-rate substitution matrix**
- **Ward hierarchical clustering**

The optimal number of clusters is determined using:

- silhouette width
- cluster interpretability

Clusters represent distinct **respiratory failure trajectory phenotypes**.

---

# Environmental Exposure Variables

Long-term ambient exposure estimates are assigned using patient geography.

Primary exposures:

- **PM₂.₅** — long-term fine particulate matter exposure
- **NO₂** — long-term nitrogen dioxide exposure

Exposure values are standardized (z-scores) prior to modeling.

---

# Outcomes

Primary outcome:

- In-hospital mortality or hospice discharge

Secondary outcomes:

- ICU length of stay
- Need for invasive mechanical ventilation
- Timing of mechanical ventilation
- Respiratory failure severity

---

# Statistical Modeling

Each site performs the following models locally.

### Trajectory Phenotype Model

Multinomial logistic regression: trajectory_cluster ~ PM2.5 + NO2 + age + sex + race

---

### Mortality Model

Logistic regression: death_or_hospice ~ PM2.5 + NO2 + trajectory_cluster + covariates

---

### Interaction Models

death_or_hospice ~ NO2 * trajectory_cluster and PM2.5 * trajectory cluster


These models test whether pollution exposure modifies mortality risk differently across trajectory phenotypes.

---

### Landmark Survival Model

A **72-hour landmark survival analysis** evaluates mortality risk beyond the initial trajectory window.

---

# Federated Analysis Framework

Because patient-level data cannot be shared across sites, the project uses a **federated analysis approach**.

Each site executes the full pipeline locally and exports only:

- cluster summaries
- trajectory signatures
- regression coefficients
- model diagnostics

No patient-level data are shared.

Central analysis then performs:

- cross-site cluster harmonization
- pooled meta-analysis of exposure associations

---

# Project Outputs

Each site produces PHI-safe outputs including:

### Trajectory Outputs

- trajectory cluster assignments
- representative sequence plots
- cluster signature plots

### Cluster Phenotype Summaries

- cluster severity
- SOFA scores
- comorbidity burden
- vasopressor exposure

### Exposure Association Results

- trajectory association models

Final outputs are saved in: output/final
